# Astro_SaaS
Astro_SaaS is a modular FastAPI-based SaaS platform for astrology and numerology analysis, featuring layered architecture, reusable analysis engines, and scalable API-driven design aimed at building an AI-ready report generation system.
The project focuses on building a clean, extensible system using modern backend practices such as layered design, modular engines, and API-driven workflows.
This repository represents an ongoing effort to design and implement a professional-grade backend system that combines domain logic with software engineering best practices.

**🧭 Project Vision**

The goal of Astro_SaaS is to create a structured analysis platform where:

User inputs are processed through modular analysis engines

Insights are generated using rule-based and extensible logic

Reports are delivered via scalable APIs

The architecture emphasizes separation of concerns, maintainability, and future integration with intelligent automation workflows.

**Key principles:**

Modular SaaS Design

Domain-driven structure

API-first development

Extensible engine-based workflow

**🧩 Core Components**

FastAPI Backend – Handles APIs, validation, and request flow

Service Layer – Orchestrates business logic and engine execution

Analysis Engines – Independent modules for numerology, timeline, and report logic

Database Models – Structured data persistence using ORM

**⚙️ Tech Stack (Planned)**

Python

FastAPI

PostgreSQL

Docker (future deployment)

Modular Engine Architecture

**📌 Current Status**

This project is currently in the foundation and architecture phase, focusing on:

Project structure setup

Backend skeleton development

API design planning

Engine architecture definition

Implementation will evolve iteratively as features are added.

**🤝 Contribution Philosophy**

This repository is being developed as a structured learning and engineering project.
The focus is on clean architecture, maintainable code, and thoughtful system design rather than rapid feature accumulation.
